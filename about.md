Hello! 

I'm Maria! I like the color yellow, biking, and making things. On the weekends, you can catch me exploring Cleveland and cooking up a storm.

I'm a third year systems biology major at Case Western Reserve University, currently seeking a fall internship in brand strategy or product design. In the meantime, I'm leading the promotions team at UPB to define the UPB brand. I'm also having a great time helping out HackCWRU with everything design and promotions related.

My favorite classes this semester are both product-focused: in one, we're creating a medical device, and in the other, we're tackling information design in a local ICU.
