Hello! 

I'm Maria! I like the color yellow and making things. On the weekends, you can catch me exploring Cleveland and/or biking.
I'm a fourth year systems biology and computer science major at Case Western Reserve University. I'm graduating in May! 

I'm very interested in how things get made and coming up with new ideas. This semester, I'm in an independent study researching the gap between user research and derived insights from that research. At the same time, I'm learning a lot about product design.

The <a href=" http://mariakuznetsov.tumblr.com/" target="blank">previous version of this site </a> was hosted on Tumblr and included only portfolio pieces.

This site is loosely based on a template by <a href="http://diezcami.github.io" target="_blank"> Camille Diez. </a>
