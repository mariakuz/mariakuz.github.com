Hello! 

I'm Maria! I'm a product designer who enjoys bringing delightful experiences to life. Functional and engaging experiences are very important to me - I love using a technology-led design process to meet and exceed human needs.

I graduated from Case Western Reserve University in May 2018 with a dual degree in computer science and systems biology and a minor in product design. I've had the chance to work with companies such as [Google](https://mariakuz.github.io/work/2017/09/20/summer-2017.html), [Apple](https://mariakuz.github.io/work/2016/08/07/summer-2016.html), and CoinDesk and I'm still looking for what I'm doing next (preferably in San Francisco).

On the weekends, you can catch me exploring Cleveland on bike.

Let's stay in touch! Learn more about my experience on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/mariakuz/" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, or subscribe to <a href="http://eepurl.com/dgLmgH" target="_blank"> the FinkedIn Dispatch</a>, my internet-focused, weekly newsletter.

### What I've Been Up to!
Most recently, I've participated in the IDEO Spring 2018 Makeathon, started a relatively successful email newsletter, and developed CWRU's first product design minor.
