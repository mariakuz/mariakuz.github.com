Hello! 

I'm Maria! I'm a product designer who's technical and systems-oriented. Whatever the medium, I enjoy finding and solving problems that people face and getting involved at all stages of the product design process, from research to implementation. I'm interested in technology as it relates to systems, sustainability, and the future of food and have domain experience in bioinformatics/crystallography, healthcare device design, and cryptocurrencies.

I graduated from Case Western Reserve University in May 2018 with a dual degree in computer science and systems biology. I also created and earned CWRU's first minor in product design. I've had the chance to work with companies such as [Google](https://mariakuz.github.io/work/2017/09/20/summer-2017.html), [Apple](https://mariakuz.github.io/work/2016/08/07/summer-2016.html), and CoinDesk I'm currently based out of San Francisco and I'm still looking for what I'm doing next.

### What I've Been Up to!
