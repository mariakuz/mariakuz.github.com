While browsing through things to do in Cleveland, I ran into a place I'd never heard of - Gotta Groove Records. Apparently the only vertical record pressing plant in the area

How to get there: 
take the 3 bus from Superior and Wade 
or get a friend to drive you

Around the corner is Koko's Bakery and their coconut buns are amazing!
