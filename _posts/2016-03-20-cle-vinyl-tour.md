While scoping through things to do in Cleveland, I ran into a place I'd never heard of - Gotta Groove Records. Apparently the only vertical record pressing plant in the area

How to get there: 
take the 3 bus from Superior and Wade 
or get a friend to drive you

Around the corner is Koko's Bakery and their coconut buns are amazing!

Gotta Groove Records
Asiatown, record pressing company

Wax Mage Record Showcase
Detroit Shoreway, one night only, people from Gotta Groove Records

Well Made Music
78th St Studios, exclusive tour, record cutting company
bonus sound engineering
