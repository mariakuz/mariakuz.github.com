summary: Enhancing the CWRUchella event experience
---
College students love music festivals. How could we convincingly sell our event and bring it closer to an authentic festival experience? Armed with $400 and under a week of work time, I decided some 4 foot tall floral letters were the answer. 
A few design constraints:
	* budget ($400)
	* time - depending on when people would arrive back on campus, we could have anywhere from 1 other person to 4 other people helping out, but most people were busy with Orientation Week 
	* appeal - if these letters didn't make people stop and stare, they were not going to be displayed
	* environmental impact - trying to reduce the waste produced with these letters, as well as making sure that they could be reused

Inspired by large installations at festivals and the resurgence of flower crowns, I mocked up what I thought these letters could be. I wanted something with physical depth so they seemed more impressive. Originally, they would spell "CWRUchella," but in the interest of time, CWRU would be more feasible. Looking for foam and cardboard letters online, they seemed kind of expensive and not quite the right typeface for the event. I also thought of stacking and cutting foam to create the letters, but I realized if given the chance, I wanted to reduce the amount of styrene our organization would be introducing into the waste stream. Our advisor recommended asking the local bar for boxes, which, combined with some boxes we scavanged during move in, was enough to make all the letters.

I looked into the sturdiest way to put together cardboard and decided on hot glue and gum tape. I chose a typeface that would be flatter on bottom for increased stability since it would be windy. Before proceeding, I consulted with some engineering friends on the committee and had them take a look at my mockup. After some calculations, I went ahead and ordered 600 flowers, which in the end, was cutting it close.

As the event approached, I grew nervous. What if not enough people showed up to help? What if it looked stupid? Some people told me that this project seemed too hard. At some point, I just went for it. If the whole thing became a mess, we would set up a DIY flower crown station with the flowers. 

We sent out a sign up sheet with detailed instructions - I wanted the project specifications to be detailed enough that even if I wasn't there, people could work on the project.

Steps to do.

The key steps were:
* printing out and taping the template
* cutting out the back of the letters
* cutting boxes into 6" wide strips for the sides
* gluing the letters together and reinforcing them with gum tape
* painting the letters
* somehow attaching the flowers

After arriving on site and seeing the flowers, we realized that we would have to anchor the flowers into the letters somehow. After an adventure to Home Depot, where the tallest man in Cleveland Heights helped us break down a large piece of insulation, we were back on track. We even added a picture of us from Home Depot to our social media as a way of providing a fun behind-the-scenes look at the evnet. Even though I was initially anti-foam, the material was a good fit for the project and would allow us to stick the flower picks into the letters in a way that we could later recover the flowers.

Our steps after that were:
* breaking the foam into pieces that would fit into the letters
* gluing the foam inside the letters
* arranging and inserting the flowers 
* adding leftover foliage as accents

By providing clear instructions and delegating work, the letters came together pretty quickly! We finished them a day early. 

During the event, tons of people stopped by at our photo spot to take pictures. It was really exciting to see my idea come to life!
