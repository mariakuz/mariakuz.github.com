summary: Creating the UPBeats brand and design system.
---
Spot Night was UPB's weekly concert night series. After deliberation, it was converted into a monthly series featuring larger artists.

With the new UPBeats brands, I wanted students to trust in UPB.

I put together a marketing brief and created a logo. It was a little tricky since I wasn't able to get useful feedback over the summer. At some point, I went ahead on my own terms, but I wish I had more time to refine the final idea.

Part of the brief stated, 
<quote> "When you give a friend a mixtape, they understand that it's carefully chosen and they know that while it might not match their tastes perfectly, it's a good starting point for branching out." </quote>

After looking at other music services like Apple Music and Spotify, I realized I wanted to bring in the live music aspect. We had discussed that we wanted shows to be a chill, no-judgement zone.

The right-facing arrow would be UPB's stamp of approval: we hand-picked this for you, come in! I also created a mixtape icon for use on social media and as a design element.

Once the logo was created, it would be used for many swag items, in conjunction with the mixtape icon. Throughout the first semester, those would be: <br/>
* a neon sign <br/>
* white ink stickers (cheaper than vinyl cut but with similar effect) <br/>
* keylight bottle openers <br/>
* t-shirts <br/>
<br/>

<br/>
The most amazing of all of them was the neon sign! I'd never thought that people could just get those, but after a few months of waiting, we were able to hang it in the venue (The Jolly Scholar)!

In the past, students have brought up that they don't know the artist playing. This new template featured the genre at the top, also with a description of the band's sound. 

The template would be used throughout the semester by members of the promo team and it was made for use with a a variety of images.

<div class= "cover">
<img alt ="template for high res images" src= "/images/upbeats/upbeats_template-03.png"/> <br/>

</div>
One poster in use (using what the template finally became)

I also carried the brand voice into the drink tickets that we would give out.
