summary: The first stop of your Friday night.
---
Spot Night is a free concert night, held on Fridays, hosted by the University Program Board. This would be the last semester Spot Night would exist before being scrapped for the coming year. Lagging attendance and location changes throughout the year, coupled with frequent band cancellations created some interesting situations.

<h3>Facebook Events</h3>
Unlike the last time I was Spot Night Facebook-event-maker, I decided to make custom event page photos, as opposed to just finding an image of the band. Once I created a template, it was just a lot of finangling to get the image placed right. I used text and color elements from the flyer, but next time, I think sticking to the same font and maybe only changing the color of the logo would lend a lot more cohesion.

<h3>Flyers</h3>
Physical flyers were printed every week and also shared on our Facebook page. Creating images for Instagram is one way I hope to boost our online presence next year. For each poster, I used a different sans-serif font and a bright color scheme. There was no real template for how each poster would look, and often the layouts would be created before the band was booked. I'm not sure if I like how different they all look, but it was interesting for me to explore a more minimal style.

<h3>Alternative Flyers</h3>
In past years, Spot Night was on Thursday. "I thought that was Thursday? I was thinking of going..." was a common response, implying that people not only didn't care enough to go, but they didn't care enough to check the date. Since the Spot Night brand was going to be cut, it didn't seem worthwhile to strongly pursue the connection between the shows and Fridays, but we did print a round of these posters. The Friday motif is filler for when bands are not playing.

Most months, the bands were not booked for the month ahead so I was unable to use any of the lineup templates.

<h3>Drink Tickets</h3>
Towards the end of the semester, we handed out drink tickets in order to entice people to the Spot. Our organization voted on allowing student fees to pay for alcohol this winter, but this new policy has some restrictions that we are still working on. Drink tickets like these would need to be reworked for more accurate tracking of attendance numbers. These tickets were valid for any beverage and we emphasized the transition to the campus bar for the last few shows.
