summary: Creating a name for fall concert.
---
Trashed Out Cashed Out Tour (later changed to Concert per agency request) was CWRU's 2017 fall concert, with headliners Waka Flocka Flame and Lil Dicky. 
Previous concerts had been considered a flop, but our concert director was determined to turn that around.

The committee had been talking about naming the Fall Concert to give it better name recognition. I thought it'd be cheeky to name it as a tour, since students on campus really enjoy events that don't appear to be school-affiliated. Similarly, I wanted a name that seemed bold.

My reasoning: <br/>
Trashed Out = Waka's previous tour was called Turn Up Godz.
Cashed Out = One of Lil Dicky's past hits.
Abbreviated as TOCO, we used the name and branding elements on items we gave out, such as these collapsible water bottles.

One of my contributions that I am most proud of was introducing ADA compliant seating! We provided and advertised a space for students who might not have otherwise attended due to factors that would prevent from standing for several hours.

I also worked doors night of and was able to see how excited campus was for this show!
