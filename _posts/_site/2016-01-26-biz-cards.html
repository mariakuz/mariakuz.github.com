<p>I created my first ever business cards!</p>

<div class="post-image">

<p><br /></p>

<p>A few considerations: needed to contain my major and some information about my interests, contact info, my name, etc. I wasn’t sure what to do with all the blank space!</p>

<div class="post-image">
<img alt="I wanted to do something subtle with my name - there's a slight overprint effect." src="/images/bizcards/flat-med.png" /> <br />
I wanted to do something subtle with my name - there's a slight overprint effect.
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>Most importantly, they had to be yellow.</p>

<div class="post-image">

It's all about the angles.
</div>
<p><br /></p>

<p>I figured they’d stand out, at least a little, from the white/gray/black cards of my engineering peers.</p>

<div class="post-image">
<img alt="I actually changed my major a little while ago...whoops..." src="/images/bizcards/flat-2-med.png" /> <br />
I actually changed my major a little while ago...whoops. (I'm a systems biology major now).

<p>Sometimes, when giving out cards, people will write on the back with a little reminder of how or when you met. I made it easy by allocating some space on the back. I’ve filled in a few before with phrases such as, “design” or “Grace Hopper Conference.”</p>

<div class="post-image">
