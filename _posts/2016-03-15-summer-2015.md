Last summer, I had the opportunity to work with some pretty cool people. This post is a little past its prime, so I've kept the descriptions short.

I created a series of illustrations for a white paper on bitcoin transactions.

A little CEO/geopin hybrid for this geodomain conference.

[DomainBuyApp](http://www.domainbuyapp.com/index.html "DomainBuyApp")

A blueprint-inspired logo and color scheme for an app that makes buying domains easy.

[MoneyTripping](https://twitter.com/blr13)

A tripped-out header for an unconventional finance blog.

</div>
[Spantree](http://spantree.net/)

Last, not but least, I had the opportunity to intern at Spantree this summer! They're fantastic people and I even got to write an article on the inner workings of their blog.
