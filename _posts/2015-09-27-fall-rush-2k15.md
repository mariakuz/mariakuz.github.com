summary: I designed some sleek fall rush shirts for Phi Kappa Theta!
---
This summer, Phi Kappa Theta (Ohio Alpha Beta chapter) reached out to me for help creating some sleek shirts to wear during fall rush. I had no idea what a 'good' design would entail and a quick search only brought up parodies of masculine company logos, which were usually a little crude. Since we wanted people to wear these even after rush, they had to be CUTE.

After some initial discussion, I realized I didn't  want bright red shirts since no one actually wears those when they don't have to. The only issue? Phi Kappa's colors are cardinal purple (red) and yellow!

We briefly considered baseball shirts but set those aside in favor of a heather red. And we were committed to the heather red - it's one of my favorite parts of the end result. The final design was supposed to be printed in white and black, but due to a miscommunication, they received them in all white, which turned out pretty sharp.

<image alt="Tommy pointing out to Stephen where the crest is" src ="/images/phikap/stephen.jpg" class = "post-image"/>

I also created a calender of their rush events to hang around campus, keeping in mind that "we want it to look like a frat thing but like, in a good way."
