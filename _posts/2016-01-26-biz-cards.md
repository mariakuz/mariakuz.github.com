summary: A pop of yellow with my details.

I created my first ever business cards! 

<div class = "post-image">
<img height="auto" alt ="A close up shot." src= "/images/bizcards/thumb-med.png"/> <br/>
</div>
<br/>



A few considerations: needed to contain my major and some information about my interests, contact info, my name, etc. I wasn't sure what to do with all the blank space!

<div class = "post-image">
<img alt ="I wanted to do something subtle with my name - there's a slight overprint effect." src= "/images/bizcards/flat-med.png"/> <br/>
I wanted to do something subtle with my name - there's a slight overprint effect.
</div>
<br/>

Most importantly, they had to be yellow.

<div class = "post-image">
<img alt ="It's all about the angles." src= "/images/bizcards/diag-med.png"/> <br/>
It's all about the angles.
</div>
<br/>

I figured they'd stand out, at least a little, from the white/gray/black cards of my engineering peers.

<div class = "post-image">
<img alt ="I actually changed my major a little while ago...whoops..." src= "/images/bizcards/flat-2-med.png"/> <br/>
I actually changed my major a little while ago...whoops. (I'm a systems biology major now).
</div>
<br/>

Sometimes, when giving out cards, people will write on the back with a little reminder of how or when you met. I made it easy by allocating some space on the back. I've filled in a few before with phrases such as, "design" or "Grace Hopper Conference."

<div class = "post-image">
<img alt ="A filled out card." src= "/images/bizcards/stack.png"/> <br/>
A filled out card.
</div>
