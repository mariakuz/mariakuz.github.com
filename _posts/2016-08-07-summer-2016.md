I had the amazing opportunity to intern at Apple this summer! I spent a few months in Cupertino working as a member of the Marcom systems team creating an internal website.

Additional info is under wraps, but it was a lot of fun! I had a fun time biking 400 miles in 4 weeks, visiting Seattle, and learning from the great people around me.
