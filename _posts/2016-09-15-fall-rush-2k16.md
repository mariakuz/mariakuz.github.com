summary: A trendy rush shirt for the Phi Kaps, round 2.
---
The Phi Kaps wanted a sleek shirt for spring rush (later postponed to fall rush). The rush chair liked the look of the single weight illustration I'd done previously.

I wanted to emphasize the Cleveland connection in this design and brought in the Cuyahoga River, as well as the skyline and perpetual cloudiness.

After hand off, the rush chair decided to go with a two tone design.
