As part of my KPCB Product Fellowship application, I was asked to "Describe, in a blog post or video, the last product you used that took your breath away. Please explain what the product is, why you loved it, and any broader analysis or information you think is relevant."

I bike through Cleveland, filming one-handed as I travel from a quiet residential district to the steel yard (and back). I chose my Diamondback DualSport Trace ST for its design – it’s an amazing fit for my body and my environment. Each of its components has been carefully designed so that I can work with this product to participate in an unparalleled experience.

### Behind the Scenes 

My initial ideas included my IKEA can opener and a pleasing mug I use for coffee. While both those objects are delightful to use, I knew the one object I never stop talking about is my bike.

### Editing
The day before a snowstorm, I spent several hours biking around Cleveland. I filmed with one hand while travelling. I prepared a script and then began to free-form discuss the features that contributed to this experience.

I chose to go off-script since when I ride, I can let my mind wander, knowing that technical terrain is easy to tackle. Similarly, a video would be more immersive than a blog post.

There were many audio difficulties associated with this project. I ultimately chose to keep some unsmoothed audio and shakiness to better communicate how rough and bumpy riding in Cleveland can be (and how well my bike serves it).

### Transcript
What’s a bike even for? Getting you from place to place, a workout? A bike really isn’t about going from a point A to a point B. It’s about the experience. Can’t any bike do that? Technically, yeah. But a bike I trust, a bike that fits, a bike that works so well for me I don’t have to think about it? That’s what makes this a product that takes my breath away.

Well, this is a product that’s seamless. It fits with me, fits where I want to go. I don’t have to think about it. I don’t think my bike will ever fail.
It’s thinking I can get that light, and getting it.
It’s saying I want to go there, and getting there. It’s doing it. This bike empowers me.

I’m on a Diamondback DualSport Trace ST. The bike doesn’t matter. It’s a hybrid mountain bike. It’s more durable than a road bike but it’s lighter than a mountain bike. You know, honestly, all that doesn’t matter. All I want to do is go is fast on any surface. I want to be in control.

It fulfills everything I want from a bike -  you know - it’s got brakes, it’s got a seat, it’s got two wheels.
I’m a casual cyclist, I’m not even wearing clipless shoes. You know, sometimes you just want something you can take for a spin on some roads, on some cobbles, maybe a gravel trail.

This bike is delightful, leaves me breathless because it’s seamless. It’s invisible.
