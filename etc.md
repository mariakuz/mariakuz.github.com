During my college career, I practiced my graphic and visual design skills by working as a freelance graphic designer. I learned a lot about presenting my work, dealing with clients, and meeting vague specifications. I was lucky to work on a variety of projects!

* Keifer Wiley Album and Social Media
* [CWRU Snapchat Filters](https://mariakuz.github.io/gdesign/2016/03/21/cwru-snapchat.html)

I was able to incorporate and share many of my learnings when I became the director of promotions for the undergraduate progam board. In addition, I acted as public relations/promotions chair for multiple student organizations and was often called in to help organizations create visual identities.
